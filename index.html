                <p><b>1. What is Tarot?</b><br>
                    Tarot is an ancient divination practice that uses a deck of cards to gain insights and guidance into various aspects of life, including relationships, career, and personal growth. It's a tool for self-reflection and connecting with your intuition.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. How do your Tarot readings work?</b><br>
                    During a Tarot reading, I will use the Tarot cards to tap into your energy and provide you with intuitive insights and guidance. You may ask specific questions or simply request a general reading for a broader perspective.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. Are Tarot readings accurate?</b><br>
                    Tarot readings are subjective and based on the interpretation of the cards. While I strive to provide accurate and meaningful insights, please understand that Tarot is for entertainment purposes only and not meant to replace professional advice.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>4. How can I purchase a Tarot reading with you?</b><br>
                    Ordering a Tarot reading is easy! Simply visit the "Services" page on my website, Intuition Illumination, and choose the reading that resonates with you.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>5. What types of Tarot readings do you offer?<br></b>
                    I offer a range of Tarot readings, each designed to cater to your unique needs:

                    Absolutely! You are welcome to ask specific questions related to your life or concerns. The more specific your questions, the more focused the guidance can be.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>7. Is my personal information kept confidential?</b><br>
                    Yes, your privacy is essential to me. I treat all personal information with utmost confidentiality, and your data is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>9. Can Tarot predict the future?</b><br>
                    Tarot does not predict the future with certainty. Instead, it offers guidance and potential outcomes based on the current energies and circumstances. Your actions and choices also play a significant role in shaping your future.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>10. Are you a certified Tarot reader?</b><br>

                    <br><br>
                    <b>11. What payment methods do you accept?</b><br>
